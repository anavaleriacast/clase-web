		<p>Devendra Banhart is a master of the idiotically cosmic. On Smokey Rolls Down Thunder Canyon, his fifth album, he holes up in Topanga Canyon to make an old-fashioned psychedelic folk opus, breathing in the California spirits and listening to his beard for inspiration.You could complain that this guy needs an editor, but that's like saying a dancing bear needs a compass. Going too far is the only beat D steps to, and the funniest stuff on his albums would be the first to get cut.</p>

			<h2 style="padding-bottom: 2%;"> Mala (2013)</h2>
			<p>Banhart has eased back on multiple levels after increasingly ambitious records, digging up pre-Beatles concepts of pop and rock while writing from non-punk states such as loving with levity and aging with grace. Most importantly, these are by far Banhart's most plainspoken and legible songs. Considering they're in the form of soft-shoe jazz or playful R&B, there isn't urgency per se, so much as immediacy resulting from how Mala often feels like snippets taken from Banhart's daily life. </p>
